# Assignment Downloader

Script to download assignments easily from course CS-A1140 Data Structures and Algorithms

What this script does:

1. Downloads given URL

    - You can give the URL as command line argument. If you don't do this the script will ask for it

1. Checks if directory exists

    a. If it exists, it will open directory in VSCode

    b. If it doesn't exist it will extract the downloaded file into correct round directory, commit the addition and open VSCode

## Notes

- Each round has to have own directory (r1, r2, r3...)
